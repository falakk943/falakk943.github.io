        <h1>Welcome to Jackson Heights </h1>
        <p>Jackson Heights represents the fusion of all New York City within one small neighborhood, that is particularly resided in one area which I think is one of my most favorite places in this city. That is the corner of 73rd street, Broadway. This tidy area in one of the most renowned neighborhoods in Queens is a place that has all walks of life from all different cultures, backgrounds, race, etc. While walking down these streets, I see all different kinds of people, restaurants, small businesses, carts, stands and pretty much everything that one would see in an area that never sleeps. You’ll see pretty much everyone of all different colors and races. It’s a very lively place with all different kinds of people conversing with others from all cultures and backgrounds, children racing down the street, some kind of events that bring all people together, etc.
        </p>
        <p2>When I walk down this street, I am always seeing hard-working individuals trying to sell the hot and delicious kinds of foods from their mini halal carts, the churro carts, grilled peanut carts, drink stands and so much more. The different types of restaurants and cuisines down the street with food that I can see through the big glass windows/displays, which show how this is one of the best areas to always get wonderful and exquisite foods and dine in some of the best restaurants in Queens. The various restaurants and small grocery stores down this block that are always busy and crowded with all kinds of people who are always trying the magnificent food and the fresh groceries these places are always offering, is what I always see while I am walking down there. The unique connections within all these people are some notable highlights of this street. This one street to me is just the melting pot of all different kinds of people and things that anyone can visit to get a representation of themselves and their backgrounds.
